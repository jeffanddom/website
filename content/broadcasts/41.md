The day has arrived. Finally – we can play a game together and blow up the other tank! It’s a little tricky to aim, as we’re always shooting at where the other player was instead of where they are, but we’ll start getting into the prediction business sometime soon.  After adding OVERDRIVE mode last week to help clients catch up to the server, this week we added a slowdown message to bring clients back to normal speed. And we accidentally created a great railgun for our tanks, but it was just a bug…for now.

Notes/highlights

- Our favorite Overwatch video talking about re-applying movement state to predict behavior on the client. We’re not there yet, but we’ll be looking to this technique as inspiration: https://youtu.be/W3aieHjyNvw?t=2150
- Reminiscing about the classic, strange commercials from You Don’t Know Jack, especially _UBERNÖSTRUM_ https://jackboxgames.bandcamp.com/track/ubern-strum
- Typescript `Partial` types are helping us access a subset of our simulation state in individual systems https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#partialtype
- We enjoyed the (old) library of game development glitches at I Get Your Fail http://igetyourfail.blogspot.com
