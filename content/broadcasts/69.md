This is one of those sessions where the look of the game changes a lot in a short period of time. We move a bunch of our graphical experiments into the main game program, most notably the “wiresolid” object renderer. We also throw in high-DPI rendering and scroll-wheel zooming. On a lark, we happily discover that the multiplayer implementation still works.
