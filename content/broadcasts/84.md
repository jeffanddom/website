A high pressure system rolls into Manchester, and it brings a whole lot of weather with it. Or at least, one kind of weather for now...

First, we add some more logarithmic sliders to our particle tool, and adjust the positions of our emitters on the dog. Then, the autumn leaves blow in, and it's time to cozy up by the fire with a mug of hot chocolate.

Notes/highlights:

- In discussing more Disco Elysium, we bring up Twine (a text adventure engine: https://twinery.org) and Digital: A Love Story (https://scoutshonour.com/digital/) as other quality text adventure content.
- Recoil – the javascript library, not the game mechanic – is a neat tool for state management in React that is a clearer and lighter-weight solution than Redux (blech) https://recoiljs.org
- Docker :( That is all.
- Sometimes your dog needs some goggles, and apparently those are just called "doggles"
- Syntorial is a really neat iPad/Mac app for learning the ins-and-outs of creating sounds on a synthesizer https://www.syntorial.com
