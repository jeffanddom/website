We test drive a new engine feature moves particle emitters in sync with game entities. Dom’s rave review of the results: “Now the dog looks like it’s puking”. With that in the bag, we decide update the rocket triggering mechanism so the player only gets one rocket per button press. This is America, after all…no more handouts to rocket fans! Plus: Disco Elysium first takes, the Russian Civil War, and proto-communism in your favorite early civilizations
