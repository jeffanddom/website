With a lot of the groundwork out of the way, we begin adding some real features to the particle emitter tool. The tool gets color adjustments, autosave, and fancy double-handed sliders. JavaScript reveals itself to be a poor language for serializing class instances. Dom reveals himself to be a wizard of frontend web programming; the captain of the football team gives him a wedgie. Also: what Jeff did and didn’t like about Control, Suez Canal ship liberation and its discontents, and solidarity with Amazon workers in Alabama.

Notes/highlights:

- No more billionaires, please: https://twitter.com/helpmeskeletor/status/1375785389730844678
- Amazon workers in Bessemer, AL are in the midst of a landmark unionization drive: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/03/amazon-bessemer-union-leaders-labor-movement-us
- Quaternions are hard to understand. Most of us just memorize assorted facts about them, like how multiplication is non-commutative: http://www.zipcon.net/~swhite/docs/math/quaternions/commutativity.html
