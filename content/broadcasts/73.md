Jeff gets a PS5 and uses it exclusively to stream Netflix. The chatroom proceeds to goad us into adding a dog to the game; we comply. Dom immediately spends $30 on low-poly dog models. We fumble around with Blender’s bisect tool for 20 minutes in an attempt to separate a dog’s head from the rest of its body. We are forced to add more code to the renderer to get the dog to render correctly. Instead of tanks, the game now has dogs with guns.
