It's a wild ride today. We learn about how thimbles work, the history of Monopoly pieces, fantasy languages, incorrect idioms, unintentionally right-wing quotes, and anti-neanderthal sentiment.

Through all that, we do actually seek out and document some mysteries in our netcode. They're pretty interesting and remain unsolved, but we're a lot closer to fixing them.
