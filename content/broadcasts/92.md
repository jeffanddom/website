After re-introducing pathfinding last session, we check out the new path caching Jeff added, but realize that the l1 algorithm we picked can only move in 90 degree angles. So we embark on an exploration of other algorithms available to us, and aim for the bright future of builders knowing how to walk diagonally.

Notes/highlights:

- Today we learned about shiba inu coin via Vitalik Buterin's donation to India's crypto COVID relief. We're skeptical. https://qz.com/india/2009531/vitalik-buterin-donates-ethereum-shiba-inu-to-indian-covid-fund/
- Jeff added an LRU cache to our pathfinding based on the current state of the game grid https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)
- Some of the pathfinding resources we look at:
    - pathfinding.js https://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/
    - Navigation meshes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh
    - Pretty much all of Red Blob Games https://www.redblobgames.com
