As we continue to integrate spatial indexing into the game, we take a couple of field trips. First, we refine some function names that make our multiplayer prediction system much easier to understand. Naming things is hard! Then, we take another shot at improving our frame rate issues, this time looking into how our background terrain gets drawn.

Notes/highlights:

- This is an important election for many reasons. If you’re a voter in California, please consider voting against Prop 22, which would dismantle hard-won protections for gig workers: https://www.gigworkerscollective.org/prop-22
- Safari’s JavaScript engine has performance issues with some language primitives like `let` and `const`: https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/478
- Many languages have a notion of “divmod”, an operation that returns both the quotient and remainder of an integer vision. C has it in its standard libraray: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/div/
