TFW the vaccine hits ✨

Here come some more mortars. We've got a funky version of our ballistic motion in place already, but this stream we start diving into actually calculating the correct angle for our shots. A lot of trigonometry is on the table in this session, so if you remember your high school math and physics classes, it's a great time to tell us how hard we're making this on ourselves.

Notes/highlights:

- We spend a lot of time digging in to this particular Quora answer around ballistic physics, and it’s an invaluable reference, even though we dunk on the tone of the answer just a bit: https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-calculate-the-angle-at-which-a-projectile-should-be-fired-to-hit-a-target
- Dom's playing Returnal. It's pretty rad, but has a lot of funny game loop mechanics that don't hit nearly as hard as Hades. The aesthetics are off the hook, but the risk-reward experience is often just too punishing.
- The web has been slowly ruined by cookie popups, and there's no obvious savior in sight. Special thanks to the EU's GDPR and California's CCPA.
- Speaking of awful web technologies, AMP – accelerated mobile pages from Google – may be on its last legs. And good riddance! https://9to5google.com/2021/04/19/google-search-page-experience
