We pull all the wires out of Manchester’s 2D renderer, in the hopes of replacing it with a shiny new OpenGL replacement. There are many blank stares as we try to remember how matrix multiplication works. To our shared surprise, we’re able to get terrain rendering working, although something about the colors seems a bit off…

Notes/highlights

- A nice explainer on the difference between normalized device coordinates and other coordinate systems: https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/a/1771
- In case you haven’t heard, a little game called Cyberpunk 2077 was recently launched. We’ve got mixed feelings: it’s the same studio that brought us Witcher 3, one of the great games of the past console generation, but this time around the politics and marketing have been a bit iffy: https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/22058784/cyberpunk-2077-marketing-cd-projekt-red-transphobia
