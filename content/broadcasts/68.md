Join us for an exploration of future gameplay ideas, before diving back into our shader exploits. As much as we love “steve shading”, we’re now calling our method the “wiresolid” shader. We walk through the pros and cons of the different techniques we’ve been experimenting with, and add a few additional tweaks – such as anti-aliasing!

We learn a great deal about our screen-space derivatives for edges, and found even more OpenGL features that we wish we could use but that aren’t available in WebGL. Ultimately, we decided to commit to “wiresolid” shading for our models with our current limitations, and are ready to begin adding it to the actual game!

- “The Mother of All Games” Scorched Earth is a real classic of DOS-era gaming https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Earth_(video_game)
- Oft-referenced, we once again revisit Florian Bösch’s barycentric wireframe method https://web.archive.org/web/20200523142333/http://codeflow.org/entries/2012/aug/02/easy-wireframe-display-with-barycentric-coordinates/
- While we searched far and wide for a “noperspective” option in WebGL, we ultimately discovered that it’s reserved for future use and not a feature we can use.
- Matt DesLauriers has a really excellent WebGL wireframe demo https://mattdesl.github.io/webgl-wireframes/app/
