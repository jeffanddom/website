Finally, the game gets the thing you’ve all been waiting for: rocket launchers. The ballistics look great, but we stumble into a new problem: how do we attach particle emitters to moving objects? Not a hard problem for a single-player game, but rather tricky in multiplayer. Along the way, we do some necromancy and bring our old HUD code back from the grave. Also: we discuss the Dogecoin boom, the slightly less impressive but still-booming XLM boom, and our accidental cryptocurrency wealth.
