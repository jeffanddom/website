In between trading tips about Hades (one of the best games of the year!), we continue plugging away at our spatial partitioning system.

Notes/highlights:

- Paradise Killer, a vaporwave detective game that’s been making the rounds: http://paradisekiller.com/
- Ever have a program that uses the same data type for different concepts, like currencies and measurements, and wished the typechecker could tell them a part? That’s called an “opaque data type”, which some languages support, but not TypeScript. But there are some hacks you can try: https://spin.atomicobject.com/2018/01/15/typescript-flexible-nominal-typing/
- TypeScript (and some later versions of JavaScript) has the nullish coalescing operator (??), which lets you concisely declare default values for expressions that might be undefined or null: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator
- oreboot, surely the most cleverly-named open firmware project there is: https://github.com/oreboot/oreboot
- We won’t have our regular Monday night stream on November 2, because Dom is a poll worker and will be doing election prep. By the way, please make sure you know how and where to vote! This website makes it easy: https://iwillvote.com/
