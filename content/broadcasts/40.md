This session marks the first appearance of “true” multiplayer in Manchester, with the game running on three different processes. It’s the first time Jeff and Dom have played the game at the same time! Of course, we run right away into a tricky bug: the game stops working if one client runs even slightly faster than the other, which means we need to compensate somehow. This is an interesting problem, but we all know you’ll watch this episode because it has cats and dogs in it.

Notes/highlights:
- Here’s the part of our much-referenced tech talk on Overwatch that addresses compensating for unhealthy clients using “time dilation”, which means changing the update framerate on clients: https://youtu.be/W3aieHjyNvw?t=1783
- The unpronounceable Valorant has a lot of interesting machinery to determine whether you hit the thing you were shooting at. This Riot Games tech blog article covers this in detail: https://technology.riotgames.com/news/peeking-valorants-netcode
