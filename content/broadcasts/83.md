Emitters keep on emitting, and today we're adding explosions to our bullet hits. We've put so much good work into the particle system, that today we get to create and try out a variety of explosions in the game with an instant feedback loop.

We add gravity physics to our particles – letting the dust settle accurately from our new, majestic explosions – and update our particle tool to use a logarithmic scale for slider increments (making it easy to tweak small values).

Notes/highlights:

- FLoC (federated learning of cohorts) is an experiment in Chrome to make browser cookies that provide privacy, but very few people think it's a good idea https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea
    - We don't have to be beholden to Google services - try Fastmail or Hey.com instead of Gmail (and there's a bunch of replacements for the rest of their services too!)
- Go play Disco Elysium if you're still way behind like Dom – it's a strange, stylish, spectacularly written role-playing experience that gives you as much room to shape your character's politics as it does your crime solving method.
    - The extremely complex dialog system can be explored fully in this online visualizer https://disco-reader.gitlab.io/disco-reader/#/ (but is probably full of spoilers)
- Warez is over, and media companies seem to have gotten most people to pay to watch media – and yet artists make less money than when CD sales were king https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyolson/2021/03/03/are-music-streaming-companies-finally-ready-to-change-the-way-they-pay-artists/?sh=2bb340c72f63
- Logarithmic functions are the inverse of exponential functions, and this common conversion is key to our updated slider ranges https://www.mesacc.edu/~scotz47781/mat120/notes/exp_to_log/exp_to_log_intro.pdf
