There’s some game programming crammed in at the very end, but this one’s mostly about one of the most important games released in the past decade. That’s right, this is the big Disco Elysium spoiler episode. We talk about time mechanics, the ending, the Left, how drugs and cops are portrayted, and the significance of trying to punch Cuno and missing.
