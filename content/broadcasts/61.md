Our modeling system continues to progress! After working with the limitations of OBJ models, we decided to switch our model format to glTF (GL Transmission Format). We like this format a lot - today, it makes it easier for us to address and animate parts of the model with a predictable hierarchy, and in the future provides support for a lot of advanced modeling features. 

To start the day, we tracked down a bug in our new glTF render pipeline and got our tank rendering from the new format. Then, we were able to add a new data type to our entities that tracks model modifications on a mesh-by-mesh level. The end result is that we can now turn our tank’s turret in three dimensions!

Happy New Year to all, and here’s hoping for a safer 2021!

Notes/highlights:

- We're big fans of Opus Magnum! It’s fun take on small programming puzzles, and Zachtronics games are always a brain-bending treat: https://www.zachtronics.com/opus-magnum/ 
- The quick-reference we’re using for glTF is in this PDF: https://github.com/javagl/gltfOverview/releases/download/v2.0.0b/gltfOverview-2.0.0b-8pages.pdf 
- To have our Blender-based scale and rotation operations denormalized to all the individual vertices, we can use the “Apply” menu  https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/scene_layout/object/editing/apply.html 
- Now deprecated, OpenGL “matrix stacks” are an old-school way to handle the multiple nested object transforms we’re looking at today https://www.glprogramming.com/red/chapter03.html#name6 
- macOS design has taken another shift recently, and between skeuomorphism and flat design is…neumorphism? https://www.core77.com/posts/100422/Apples-UI-Design-Aesthetic-Moving-Towards-Neumorphism
