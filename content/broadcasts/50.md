This is our 50th Twitch stream since we started this project. Five-Zero! Wow!! We're having such a fun time, and here's to 50 more ✨

For the first hour, we continued our move to immutable objects in our game systems and applied our ComponentTable pattern to our damageable objects. In the process, we had to refactor both our Damageable and Hitbox classes to be pure data types instead. We followed the Typescript errors and were able to refactor cleanly...but only after touching nearly ever entity!

In the second half, we did a double-stream of Hades – each of us playing our own run with the same weapon and trying to be the fastest to beat the final encounter (based on the in-game timer). Jeff snuck in the win just under the wire!

- Really, we can't recommend Hades enough. Jeff is playing on PC, Dom is playing on Switch. https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/
