Our goal today was to attach multiple clients to the server. Instantiating multiple clients means we had to split the game object into "client" and "server" portions, a change that we started working on last stream. Along the way, we encountered a significant slowdown when running a second client loop, which means some optimization is due.

Notes/highlights

* ["1500 Arches on a 28.8"](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131503/1500*archers_on_a_288_network*.php), a classic article about the low-bandwidth multiplayer implementation in Age of Empires
* [8-Bit Game Graphics Converter](http://www.retromancers.com/retro/), a website that will downres your photos with retro style
* We teased our website! Soon to be at [jeffanddom.com](https://jeffanddom.com), although it's not quite hooked up yet.
* We came out of the stream somehow a little more disappointed with the cast of Monty Python.
