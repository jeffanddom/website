After our successful multiplayer trials, we considered updating more of our existing gameplay for netplay. However, it was clear that we had a growing performance problem in some of our systems that required a deeper fix. Enter the Quadtree: a data structure that provides logarithmic-time lookup for an entity in our map based on its position. We implemented and tested multiple subroutines for the tree, and are excited to put all the pieces together in our next session.

Notes/highlights

- Wikipedia for the Quadtree data structure we’ll be implementing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree
- Nuggs – “the Tesla of Chicken” – makes a version-controlled vegan chicken that Jeff has been enjoying https://eatnuggs.com
- We learned that we’ve all been counting wrong, and the new millennium didn’t start until 2001. Thanks a lot Pope Gregory.
