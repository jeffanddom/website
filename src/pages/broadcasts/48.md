Dom returned to the stream after a hard weekend of public service, only to find that the game no longer has a entity class. Instead, we’ve got a bunch of maps and sets, keyed by entity ID. It sures seems like you can take the web programmers away from the web, but you can’t take the web out of the web programmers. After that, we finally turned on some old systems like turrets, but have to deal with the perennial problems: bad synchronization logic and poor performance.

Notes/highlights:

- Gabriel Gambetta’s series of articles on client/server game architecture covers all of the stuff we talk about on stream, plus more. A good overview of client prediction, dead reckoning, reconciliation, interpolation, and lag compensation: https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html
