We fixed some gnarly frame rate issues! To help with the optimization, we built an FPS display into the debug overlay, which ended up being so cool that maybe it should just be the whole game.

Notes/highlights:

- The new website is done-ish. Check it out at https://jeffanddom.com. Nice work, Dom! We took our inspiration from the character select screen from Turtles in Time (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles:_Turtles_in_Time).
- The game is now code-named "Manchester". "yolorts" was an awkward mouthful. We picked the new name for a number of different reasons, not least of which is the eponymous city's storied role in punk and post-punk (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music_of_Manchester).
- We discussed the idea of games that are basically just a number going up, e.g. Cookie Clicker (https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/).
- We use JavaScript's setTimeout and setInterval functions to run the game update loop. Our viewer Eric pointed out that the behavior of those functions isn't very precise, and varies between browsers: https://github.com/jeffanddom/manchester/commit/0ad5aeb2b1d70139c29ce1cdf2e3200632f907b5#r41996586
