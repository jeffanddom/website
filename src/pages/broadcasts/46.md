After reviewing Jeff’s latest type and prediction updates, we continued to pick away at simulation performance. With some digging, we spent some time indexing our entities by their individual component types. We eliminated ~30k iterations through the entity manager during re-simulation by looking entities up by component type, and saw our frame rate start to climb.

- We’re using an “opaque type alias” to keep our entity IDs typechecked. Since Typescript doesn’t have built-in support for opaque types, we simulate it with a clever intersection of an impossible-to-satisfy type signature: https://codemix.com/opaque-types-in-javascript/
- We briefly considered starting on webworkers today….but not this time https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers
